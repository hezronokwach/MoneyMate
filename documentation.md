Personal Expense Tracker Plan and Design
Project Overview

    Frontend: React.js with React Router and Material-UI.
    Backend: Express.js with SQLite3.
    Authentication: Basic authentication using bcrypt for password hashing and JWT for session management.
    Timeline: Monday to Wednesday evening (~24 hours).
    Pages: Login, Register, Dashboard, Expenses, Budget, Reports, Help.
    Optional Feature: Simplified savings goals with progress tracking.

System Design

    Architecture: Client-server with RESTful API and authentication.
        Frontend: React app with navigation, styling, and authentication context.
        Backend: Express.js server with SQLite3 and JWT-based authentication.
    Communication: HTTP requests with JWT tokens for authenticated routes.
    Authentication: Users must sign up and log in; tokens are stored in localStorage.

Database Design
Core Tables

    users
        id (INTEGER, PRIMARY KEY)
        username (TEXT, UNIQUE)
        password (TEXT, hashed with bcrypt)
    transactions
        id (INTEGER, PRIMARY KEY)
        user_id (INTEGER, FOREIGN KEY to users)
        date (TEXT, ISO format)
        amount (REAL)
        category_id (INTEGER, FOREIGN KEY to categories)
        description (TEXT)
        type (TEXT, 'expense' or 'income')
    categories
        id (INTEGER, PRIMARY KEY)
        user_id (INTEGER, FOREIGN KEY to users)
        name (TEXT)
        type (TEXT, 'expense' or 'income')
    budgets
        id (INTEGER, PRIMARY KEY)
        user_id (INTEGER, FOREIGN KEY to users)
        month (TEXT, e.g., '2023-10')
        category_id (INTEGER, FOREIGN KEY to categories, NULL for overall)
        amount (REAL)

Optional Tables (Savings)

    savings_goals
        id (INTEGER, PRIMARY KEY)
        user_id (INTEGER, FOREIGN KEY to users)
        name (TEXT)
        target_amount (REAL)
        deadline (TEXT, optional)

Notes:

    All tables are linked to users via user_id for data isolation.
    Savings progress is calculated as (total income - total expenses) and compared to target_amount.

API Endpoints
Authentication

    POST /register: Register a new user (username, password).
    POST /login: Log in and receive a JWT token.

Transactions (Authenticated)

    GET /transactions: Get user's transactions.
    POST /transactions: Add a transaction.
    PUT /transactions/:id: Update a transaction.
    DELETE /transactions/:id: Delete a transaction.

Categories (Authenticated)

    GET /categories: Get user's categories.
    POST /categories: Add a category.
    PUT /categories/:id: Update a category.
    DELETE /categories/:id: Delete a category.

Budgets (Authenticated)

    GET /budgets/:month: Get user's budgets for a month.
    POST /budgets: Set/update budgets.
    PUT /budgets/:id: Update a budget.
    DELETE /budgets/:id: Delete a budget.

Optional Savings (Authenticated)

    GET /savings-goals: Get user's savings goals.
    POST /savings-goals: Add a savings goal.
    PUT /savings-goals/:id: Update a savings goal.
    DELETE /savings-goals/:id: Delete a savings goal.

Notes:

    JWT middleware protects authenticated routes.
    user_id ensures data is user-specific.

Development Plan
Monday (Backend with Authentication)

    Morning: Set up Express.js, SQLite3, and database schema; implement /register and /login.
    Afternoon: Add JWT middleware; implement transactions and categories endpoints with user filtering.

Tuesday (Frontend Core with Authentication)

    Morning: Set up React app with React Router and Material-UI; create Login and Register pages; implement authentication context.
    Afternoon: Develop Expenses page (list and add); develop Budget page (budgets and savings goals).

Wednesday (Finalize)

    Morning: Implement Dashboard with charts and savings progress; develop Reports page with basic charts.
